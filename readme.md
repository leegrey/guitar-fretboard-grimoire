# The Guitar Fretboard Grimoire 

The Guitar Fretboard Grimoire is a js script for procedurally generating fretboard diagrams of various intervals, chords, and scales.

The grimoire can render charts in any tuning. By default, it will build the Grimoire in Standard Tuning, and All-fourths tuning.

## How to Build

`node grimoire.js`

## Future Plans

**Chord Generator** - As an extention to the current functionality, I'd like to write an analysis mode that generates chord voicings in various fingerings.
